## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
### Why
Currently milestones can only be added from the Web UI. There's no way to rename a milestone or edit its details once created. Users have to manually edit config or use CLI/MCP tools.

### What
Add milestone editing capabilities to the Milestones page:
- Add an "Edit" button/icon on each milestone card
- Allow renaming milestones (with validation for duplicates)
- When renaming, update all tasks that reference the old milestone name
- Add ability to delete/remove a milestone (with confirmation)
- When deleting, option to reassign tasks to another milestone or leave unassigned

### Related
- task-344 added MCP milestone management (list/add/rename/remove)
- Should reuse the same core logic for consistency
